## Functionality
Functionality TBD
## Known Problems
1. When loading the project form a new branch, the plug-ins might not load themselves automatically and be available to use. To fix this, go to the top menu on unity and do Assets->Reimport all
This should also fix any problems with the Oculus Integration package, as it relies on plug-ins we have previously installed. Do this step before declaring there is something wrong with the project.
