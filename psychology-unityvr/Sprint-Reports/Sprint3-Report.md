# Sprint 3 Report (10/7/21 - 11/11/21)

## Video Report: https://youtu.be/F9kcFcTRGVI

## Whats New
* Key Memory Items (the items that the user is meant to memorize) have been selected with approval from the client and included in the project.
* Basic furniture, such as chairs and tables, have been selected and included in the project.
* Windows, doors, and smaller detailed items have been selected and included in the project.
* Refactored the scene in Unity to distinguish between the non-stressful and stressful houses.
* Plan in place for how the token system will be implemented in the next sprint.

## Work Summary
Most of this sprint included choosing different assets to decorate the house, which was accomplished by assigning each team member a set of assets to provide. Otherwise, we have been brainstorming ideas with our client in our client meetings and have come up with a plan to implement a token system which gives the user an activity to do while they are traversing each room in the house.

## Unfinished Work
* Token Pick Up #4
* House Layout: Non-Stressful #12
* Menu to select which house to explore #15
* House Items: Appliances #24

## Completed Issues/User Stories
* House Layout: Windows, Doors, Details #11
* House Layout: Key Memory Items #13
* House Layout: Stressful House Edit #14
* House Items: Finding Chairs #21
* House Items: Tables #22
* House Items: Misc Decorative Items / Key Memory Items #23

## Incomplete Issues/UserStores
* Token Pick Up #4
Although we have item pickups and a token system plan in place, the token pick up feature is not complete yet and will require some more work in the next sprint.

## Code Files For Review
Since most of this sprint relates to importing assets into Unity and working with 3D models which are handled by the Unity API, there are no code files to be reviewed for this sprint.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* Working with the client to understand what they want in the VR experience and how we are able to accomplish those features.

Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Communication. Although we have set up weekly meetings, we tend to lose track of things like who is supposed to work on a specific feature. In general, we need to work on making sure we are evenly doing work and are on the same page when in comes to development.

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* Dividing work depending on who has an Oculus headset. Since we have only three headsets available and five members, there will be two members who won't have a headset at a given moment. The issues that require using a headset should be given to those who will have access to it during the sprint while the issues that don't require a headset should be prioritized for those who don't have access to the headset.
