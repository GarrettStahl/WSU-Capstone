# Sprint 1 Report (8/23/21 - 9/9/21)

## Whats New
* Base unity project created and is available in the repository
* README template with all the information we have available to put in the file for the time being

## Work Summary
Team for the psychology-unityVR senior design project has been formed, and baseline work has begun. Nikolaus Walton has taken the role of team lead for the proejct, and has met with the client to get early introductions and basic ideas / knowledge about what the project client is looking for. We have completed the Project Description assignment for the course which acts as a document to see our understanding of what the project is asking us to do as developers. We have also scheduled our first coaching meeting to occur the first saturday after this sprint, and have scheduled follow up meetings with the client which has been scheduled such that a majority of the team will be able to attend. As our project is early in its design/planning stage, the more ideas we have from everyone the better.

The client also expressed interest in the possibility of having a alpha / beta test of 
the VR software available to them by December, so they are able give us notes to fine tune the environments for them in the spring for the final product. It is not a hard requirement, but is something that optimistically should be do able when looking at how user friendly Unity documentation is and the resources available to us online.

## Retrospective Summary

Here's what went well:
* Setting up the team discord quickly to commuinicate more effectively
* Meeting with the client as soon as possible to have background knowledge for the Project Description document and the README
* Coming up with necessary clarifying questions before client meetings to speed up the meeting and have more time for general discussion at the end
* Inviting the client and the client agreeing to joining our teams discord, which will allow both parties to commuinicate faster on a regular basis
  
Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Nothing major that we need to see to improve for now

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* With the next sprint being longer, Nik would like to have weekly stand-up "meetings"  so everyone is clear one what has been done and what needs to be done. Does not have to be actual meetings since team availability is strict this semester, but can be just a standard prompt we answer a the start of the week on our Discord server
