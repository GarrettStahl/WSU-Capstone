## What's New (User Facing)
* Detail adjustments to main environment
* More neutral house assets
* Token placement
* Fixed lighting in neutral house
  

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
House is now significantly fleshed out, nearing finalization. Detailing was added to the main room environments such as window panes as well as different flooring textures to each room to more accurately depict a real house. More neutral house assets such as furniture and other small objects were also added later to make the house look more lively and feel more like a home. Furthermore, tokens have now been placed, however their placement is probably not final and will likely be revised in the future to meet the clients preferences/desires. Token placement is only done for the neutral house but adding them to the stressful house should be very straightforward and simple since their placement will be the same across both environments. Finally, the lighting issues that started happening in the neutral house have now been dealt with and fixed. 

## Unfinished Work
* Pause Menu #42 - we will need to double check to see if pausing needs to be implemented
* Selection Menu #15
* Tutorial Room #48
* Interactive Drawers/Cabinets #53
* Digital Clock that displays the Real world Time #52
* Figure out how to share the app to the screen in the THC-Lab Room #51

## Completed Issues/User Stories
* Room Environment Detailing - Static #50
* Find normal house assets #55
* More Neutral-House Assets #60
* Token Placement #56
* Fix Lighting in the neutral house #63
* Send renders of the memory items to Aria #68
* Finish one or two room of the stressful house and send images to Dr.Cuttler #69

## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
* Figure out how to share the app to the screen in the THC-Lab Room #51: Incomplete because Oculus Quest 2 interface has proved to be quite restrictive, however different approach to the solution involving AirPlay is being explored.

## Code Files for Review
Please review the following code files, which were actively developed during this sprint, for quality:
* DoorScript.cs (https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2021Spring2022/psychology-unityvr/blob/main/THC-VR-Project/Assets/Doors/DoorScript.cs)
* Timer.cs (https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2021Spring2022/psychology-unityvr/blob/main/THC-VR-Project/Assets/Timer/Timer.cs)
* Door_Close_Triggers.cs (https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2021Spring2022/psychology-unityvr/blob/main/THC-VR-Project/Assets/Doors/Door_Close_Trigger.cs)
* The rest of what was implemented was the house items and tokens, so no other code needs to be reviewed.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* Better Communication
* The Client Demo

Here's what we'd like to improve:
* None. Overall we felt that this was a productive sprint.

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* Screen sharing in the THC-Lab
* Interactive Drawers/Cabinets
* Get more assets for the stressful house environment
