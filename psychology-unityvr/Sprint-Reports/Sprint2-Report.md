# Sprint 2 Report (9/9/21 - 10/7/21)

## Whats New

* The Unity project has been populated with a righ for the user to interact in the space using 
Oculus based headsets and controllers using Unity's XR tool kit for headset and controller tracking

* The timer has been implemented in the back end, but has yet to be connected to unity game assets as we are still building the scaffolding for it to interact with

* The user is able to pick up objects with the controllers, and those objects are able to collide with other objects using Unity's collision frameworks.

## Work Summary

The team was slightly behind due figuring out and purchasing the equipment needed to test work on the hardware it will be running on, but after the headsets were distributed we were more confident to begin working.

Attended weekly client meetings to thoroughly discuss their ideas and plans for the application, and to talk design since this project is also largely collaborative with the THC lab in the sense as we as a senior design team have a say in what we can do with the application. Switched to bi-weekly meetings in order for us to complete more signficant amount fo work between meetings.

Introductory code and general unity project work was only completed towards the end of the sprint, but we are confident to complete the work necessary for the prototype draft at the end of next sprint.

## Unfinished Work

All planned tasks were completed, but we likely could have done a little more work if we are being honest as a team.

## Completed Issues/User Stories

* VR Implementation: Hand Tracking #9
* Experience Timer #8
* Collision Detection For Handling Objects #7
* VR Implementation: Movement #5
* Create a basic room layout in Unity #3


## Incomplete Issues/UserStores
Currently open issues, marked as not safe to merge so waiting on merge confirmation.

* VR Implentation: Hand Pick Ups #6

Like mentioned above, the work has been completed on these, however we need to verify that they can properly be merged into main after one branch accidentally updated the project to a newer version of unity, which is not a problem since it  still works, but is more for avoiding merge conflicts.

## Code Files For Review
As of writing this majority if not all of thefiles have been provided either by Unity or Oculus, If there are any files team members have worked on personally or edited, please update this report.

## Retrospective Summary

Here's what went well:
* Was able to get the headsets out to people as fast as possible
* Client meetings went great in order to confirm things like the floor plan of the house and 

Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Commuincate, commuinicate, commuinicate. I (Nik) made the discord for us to be able to talk to eachother fast and effectively about questions and problems about the project as they happen, not after. If you are unsure about what to do, you should not keep that to yourself and ask: "what can I be doing right now" in the discord server. I am commited as a team lead to being accomodating as possible to all team members, you just need to give me more than a day notice and talk to me. 
  
* Proactivity was a little bit lacking this sprint even though we were waiting on gear. We shouldnt be waiting till the day of to be starting work, its a bad habit.


Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:

* If proactive work does not occur, Nik is going to assign everyone issues on Monday, and expect those issues to be done by midnight on the next Sunday. So if You are assigned an issue on Oct 11, it should be done on Oct 17. If a member consistently misses work, Nik will notify the professor of your inactivity.

* Ask ALL of the questions in the discord. There is no such thing as a stupid question, and its likely somene else has the same questions as you do so just ask. You should also be commuinicating about any issues or problems you have with the project, such as bugs or needing to update things, as they happen in the discord. This way everyone is on the same page.
